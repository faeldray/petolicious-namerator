petolicious-namerator
=====================
The Pet-o-licious Namerator is a World of Warcraft pet name randomizer built with Flash. It takes categorized names from an XML and randomly outputs 10 of them. The names are also filtered by category, which is selected from a dropdown menu.

Due to my lack of interest in the project, I am making the source files available to all on GitHub. My hope is that someone who owns their own website and is still interested in WoW will want to take over this project.

Note: The petnames.xml file will need to be hosted on the same domain as petname.swf. You will also need to update this URL within the Flash source to make the generator work.
